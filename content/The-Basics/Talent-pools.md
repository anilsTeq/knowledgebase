A talent pool is a way of labelling candidates. This allows you to easily locate them in the candidate database at a later date.  
  
There are two ways to add candidates to a talent pool. In the _applicant_ and _candidate _list.  
  

#### 1. Creating a Talent Pool

On the jobs list page, find the job which includes the applicant(s) that you’d like to add to a talent pool. Click on the number in the applicant column to open the applicant list.
