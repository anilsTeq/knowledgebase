You can create template jobs from which you can clone those that are commonly used. This can be useful to save time if you're creating a number of jobs and can use the same information for all of them.  
  

#### 1. Create template job

- On the home page click the green “Add New Job” button.

- On the Add Job page change the “Job opening status” to template and fill the information to would like to be saved as a template. Then click save at the bottom of the page when you have finished filling the form.

    Please note: When you change the “Job opening status” to template, the job opening fields will become non-mandatory. You can see this has happened as all the asterisks disappear.

#### 2. Assigning pre-application and additional questions

Please note: you can return to this page later by editing the job template.  
  

- You should now be brought to a page with similar information to the one below.
- Select from the list of pre-build questions to add to the standard application form.
- Use the preview button to see what the questions will look like to the applicant.

- “Pre-application” questions come before the main application form. This is an example of what they might look like. These questions can be killer questions (when killer questions are not answered correctly then they are advised that they do not meet the fundamental criteria to apply for the job).

#### 3. Publishing Options

- When adding a template, we advise leaving the publishing questions all as no and simply pressing save because jobs have to be in progress for candidates to apply.
