/*
Title: Where are my expired jobs?

*/
You can access your expired jobs in the jobs list table.  
  

- On the jobs list page (click jobs on the top menu), you can use the job opening status drop down box to search for the expired jobs by status. Click the search button to filter the jobs in the job list.
Please note: By default the filter automatically shows only jobs with an “In-Progress” status.

- If you do not know the job status you can also search by job title. Click the blue “Show All Jobs” button (this removes all filters), then add the job title into the job title field and click search.
