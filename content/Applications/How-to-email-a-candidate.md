- Find the desired candidate(s) in the candidate list and use the tick box on the left hand side of the table to select the candidate(s). Once you have selected candidate(s) click the “Process candidates(s)” button and select “Send Email”.

- A new page will open similar to the one below. Inside the text field a template should have loaded.
Please note: If you tick for a document to be attached which does not exist (because the candidate has not uploaded it) the email will send but without a document attached.  
  

- When you have completed the page click send to email the selected candidate(s).
Please note: If you are unsure of how the email will look you can use the green “Send Test Email” button and it will send an exact copy of the email(s) to your email address.
