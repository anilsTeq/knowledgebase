/*
Title: Can I access diversity information?

*/
  
​Administrators and recruiter users only may access a candidate’s diversity information. This data is only shown in the candidate area and never in the applicant viewer when you are processing an applicant against a job.  
  

- On the home page, on the top right action bar click on candidates.
- Find the desired candidate in the candidates list by searching for their name, email or ID number and click on their name.

- Once your candidate comes back in the search results click on their name to view their candidate record. This should look similar to the one below. Click on Diversity Details tab. You should now be able to see this candidate’s diversity details if these were collected.
  
Please note: The collection of diversity information is not normally mandatory on application forms, so candidates can choose not to provide this or select options such as “Prefer not to say”
