- If you want to publish your vacancy to the intranet, this will only work if you have intranet publishing set up.
- The green “Release to Easyweb” button will open a popup window, allowing you to send an email to the Easyweb recruitment team and to your account manager in regards to running a campaign.
- If additional boards are available they will display below the “Publish to Additional Job Boards” option when yes is selected.

- Once this page is complete click the “Save” button and the job will be published where it can be viewed in the jobs list.
Please note: the time it takes to appear on job boards will vary (up to 24 hours), depending on their own policies. This is because they may have their own quality assurance process that jobs must pass in order to be made public.
