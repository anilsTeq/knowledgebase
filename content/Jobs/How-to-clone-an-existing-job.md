Title: How to clone an existing job

As an admin you can create a clone of an existing job.  
  

- On the home page in the job lists table under the title “Clone” there is an icon you can click to clone the job.

- Information will be filled automatically into the edit job page using the information from the existing job.

 - Please note: The only sections which will not be cloned are the Location field, the Closing date field and the Hiring Manager dropdown box as these typically vary from job to job. From this page you would follow the same process as editing/creating a job.
