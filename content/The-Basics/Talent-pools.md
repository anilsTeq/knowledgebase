A talent pool is a way of labelling candidates. This allows you to easily locate them in the candidate database at a later date.

There are two ways to add candidates to a talent pool. In the applicant and candidate list.

1. Creating a Talent Pool
On the jobs list page, find the job which includes the applicant(s) that you’d like to add to a talent pool. Click on the number in the applicant column to open the applicant list.



Click on the “Process Applicant(s)” button then hover over talent pool and click “ADD NEW”.


Type in the talent pool name you’d like to add and click save.


2. Adding applicants/candidates to a talent pool
Return to the applicant list and use the tick box on the left hand side to select the applicants you would like to be added to the talent pool. Then click the “Process Applicant(s)” button, hover over talent pool and select the talent pool you would like them to be added to.


The applicants have now been added to the talent pool.
You can also create talent pools and add candidates to them in the candidate list page using the same process.


3. Finding applicants/candidates by talent pool
To find all the applicants/candidates in a talent pool go to the candidate list page.
Use the drop down menu named “Filter by Talent Pool” and select the desired talent pool. Then click search.
