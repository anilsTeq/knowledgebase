Title: What is an "auto-email" and how can I send it?

*/
An auto-email is when an email is automatically sent without you getting the chance to view/edit it. This typically occurs when an applicant’s status is changed to a status which triggers the auto-email.  
  

##### Triggering an Auto-email via a status change

- On the ATS home page, click the blue number under the applicants header to go to the applicant viewer.
