Title: Why emails can look different for each user

*/
Itâ€™s possible for the same email to look very different for different users. This could be due to a number of different reasons.

The security settings vary for different computers and email software. This could prevent images from appearing. If the images are not appearing there might be an option to enable images in the email however this option is not available on all systems.
Different email accounts will display the email differently.
Some email applications (for example gmail) change the font of all emails to their standard. This can have an effect on how the email looks, usually causing the text to show too small or too big.
