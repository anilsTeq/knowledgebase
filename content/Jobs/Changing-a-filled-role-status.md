Title: Changing a filled role status

*/
Once a role has been filled it is important to change the status so candidates cannot apply to the role and to hide the role from your hiring managers' view if applicable.  
  

- On the job list, under the heading “Status” click on the dropdown menu and select the option “Filled”.

- The status of the role has now been changed to filled. It will no longer show on the job list table unless you change the “Job Opening Status” filter criteria.
