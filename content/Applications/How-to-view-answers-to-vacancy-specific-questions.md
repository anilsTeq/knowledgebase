Title: How to view answers to vacancy specific questions

*/
You can view the answers candidates have given to vacancy specific questions in the applicant viewers.  
  

- On the ATS home page, find the job in the list of jobs the candidate has answered questions for. Under the heading Applicants the blue number shows the total number of applicants and the green number shows how many of those are new.
- Click the blue number to show all the applicants in a table and click the green number to show only the new applicants.
