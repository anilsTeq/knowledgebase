- Choose a template email from the “select the email format” question. You will then see the template email appear in the “compose message” box.
Please note: The place holder called {applicant list} will provide a full list of applicants and ID numbers. The example on the right is how the email will look once it’s forwarded.

- The email address of the assigned hiring manager will automatically appear in the “To” box.
  
Please note: The tick boxes at the bottom will attach the applicant’s documents on the email. If you tick for a document to be attached which doesn’t exist (because the candidate hasn’t uploaded it) the email will send but without a document attached.  
  

- When you have completed the page click send to forward all the selected candidates.
  
Please note: If you are unsure of how the email will look you can use the green “Send Test Email” button and it will send an exact copy of the email(s) to your email address.
