Title: Removing jobs from agencies

*/
Administrators can withdraw jobs from agencies individually if you no longer want to give them access to submit applicants for a specific job.  
  
Please note: Agencies may only view and submit candidates for jobs that have a status of “in-progress”  
  

- On the home page. Click the “Admin” button at the top right, then hover over “Agencies” and then click on “Job List”.

- You have now successfully removed the selected agency from the job. If you remove the job from all agencies then the job will not appear in the released job list.
- You will be returned back to this page where you can confirm the agency has been unassigned from the role. Hover over the blue “i” icon and the unassigned agency should not be in the list.
