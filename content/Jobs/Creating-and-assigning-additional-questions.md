Title: Creating and assigning additional questions

*/
Additional questions are at the bottom of the application form and often used for questions requiring longer answers because they are at the end.  
  

#### Creating additional questions

  
Please note: Questions requiring longer answers which appear before earlier in the application form causes the drop out rate to increase.  
  

- On the home page. Click the “Admin” button at the top right, then hover over “Form Management” and then click on “Create Additional Form Questions”.
